This Python script is designed to process an image of a cup to detect its edges and contours, 
minimize the number of contour points for optimization, and then interpolate these points to create a smooth outline of the cup.
It utilizes OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, matplotlib for visualization, and SciPy for contour interpolation.

To run this script use the main function in the main.py file
